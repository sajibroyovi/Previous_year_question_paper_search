# Previous_year_question_paper_search
This project is for the students who want to know about the previous year's question paper. Students can find that in the library but finding all those question papers is not an easy task, sometimes they might not get the particular paper as well. To make it easy for the students, I thought if they could get it Online that would be very helpful for them. So, I created an online portal for them. students can easily search the particular subjects and download them.

I used HTML, and CSS for the font end, and PHP for the back end.
The server is MySql and the language is SQL
