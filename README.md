Online Bus Ticket Reservation System is a Web based application that works within a 
centralized network. This project presents a review on the software program "Online Bus Ticket 
Reservation System" as should be used in a bus transportation system, a facility which is used to 
reserve seats, cancellation of reservation and different types of route enquiries used on securing 
quick reservations. OBTRS is built for managing and computerizing the traditional database, 
ticket booking and tracking bus and travel made. It maintains all customer details, bus details, 
reservation details. In order to achieve the design, Easy Ride Transport Company (ES) was 
chosen as a case study because of its strategic importance to Easy Ride State. Structured Systems 
Analysis and Design Methodology (SSADM) was adopted. In addition, PHP Hypertext 
Preprocessor (PHP) language was used for the front-end of the software while the back end was 
designed using MySQL. The software achieved is capable of improving the customer hand and 
relationship management in ITC operations. It is recommended that despite the present 
functionality of the designed software, an additional functionality such as the use of E-mail to 
send tickets and notifications to the customer and an online payment using credit cards/debit 
cards should be implemented into the system. Furthermore, other operations carried by ITC such 
as the courier services should also be integrated in order to enhance the system
